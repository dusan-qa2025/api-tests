API Test Automation Framework
-
This project demonstrates an API Test Automation Framework built using Java, Rest Assured and TestNG.
The framework is designed for testing RESTful APIs, validating responses, status codes, and playloads in a clean and maintainable way.

Test Stack:
-
- Java;
- Rest Assured;
- TestNG;
- Maven;
- JSON;
- Git & GitHub;

Test Scenarios:
-
- GET - retrieve list of users;
- POST - create a new user;
- DELETE - delete existing user;
- Validation of response body and headers;
- Negative test cases (authorization and server errors);
- Status code validation (200, 201, 400, 403, 500);

Future Improvements:
-
- Authentication handling (Bearer token);
- Environment configuration (dev/test/prod);
- Request/response schema validation;
- CI/CD integration;
- API test reporting;
